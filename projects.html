      <h2>Consulting Assignments</h2>
      <p><h3>Netigate</h3>
      2023
      <br>As part of a time-limited assignment, I tested and verified the usability and quality of a WebApp that leverages domain-oriented Microservice architecture to automate and scale feedbacks. I checked the functionality of the application on different systems and platforms, and from the viewpoints of both administrators and users.
      <h3>Folksam</h3>
      2021-2023
      <br>As a Java test developer in a SAFe agile automation team, I used Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, SQL and API to create automated tests. I was part of a SAFe team that focused on testing and test automation, delivering quality and functional products and services and their integrations. I also implemented a new standard for automated tests based on reusable code modules, which enhanced the efficiency and simplicity of test development and maintenance.
      
      <h3>Kronofogden</h3>
      2018-2020
      <br>As a technical tester at The Swedish Enforcement Agency, I worked on InfoService and Distribution projects. I created automated tests using Java, JUnit, SQL and XML, and conducted integration and system tests on Oracle SQL databases. I also managed test data, batch jobs, and logs in Linux.
      
      <h3>Skatteverket</h3>
      2017-2018
      <br>As a technical tester at The Swedish Tax Agency, I verified migration from Unix to Linux environment. I used SoapUI and Eclipse IDE for integration and system testing, JBehave, JUnit and Jenkins for automated testing, and managed test data, test environments, and logs in Unix and Linux.
      
      <h3>Ericsson</h3>
      2016-2017
      <br>As a member of a cross-functional team at Ericsson Cloud & IP, I integrated and tested cloud-based SDN products before customer release. I did test analysis, design, execution and troubleshooting, and worked with other Ericsson organizations to develop and update end-to-end test environments. I also handled REST API integrations and schematic and connection diagrams in Visio.
      
      <h3>Generali Czech Insurance Company</h3>
      2005-2015
      <br>As an experienced tester, I coordinated system and acceptance tests, supported databases, and conducted various types of tests. In later years, I was mainly involved in an integration project between two major insurance companies, where I delivered quality assurance, created and maintained automated test scripts using QTP/UFT and VBScript, and established test environments.</p>
