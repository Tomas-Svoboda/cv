      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Tomas Svoboda" style="width:150px; height:auto; float:right; margin-left:10px;">
      <p>This is the home page of my personal website. Here you can find a brief introduction of myself and my career goals.</p>
      <p>My name is Tomas Svoboda and I am a <span class="top">technical tester and test automation developer</span> with about 20 years experience in test and quality assurance. I have a passion for working with test automation, for example using <span class="top">Java, Python, JavaScript or TypeScript</span>, frameworks like <span class="top">Selenium, TestNG, Playwright, Cypress or Postman</span> and tools like <span class="top">Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ or Eclipse</span>.</p>
      <p>During my professional career in test, I have completed multiple courses and earned multiple certifications in testing frameworks and programming languages. I have also worked on some personal and professional projects that enhanced my skills and experience.</p>
      <p>My career goal is to become a full-stack tester and work on challenging and innovative projects that bring substantial value to clients. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools that can help me improve my test and development skills and knowledge. I am passionate about collaborating with fellow testers, developers, and clients to not only achieve but exceed our goals.</p>
